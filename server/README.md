## Overview

The `svc-assets` micro-service provides a comprehensive asset management
solution for operators. It enables clients to perform various actions such as
registering, updating, and grouping assets. Additionally, it facilitates the
delegation of grouped assets from one operator to another. This service is
accessible to existing systems through a REST API interface.
